# Comments
### Single-line
Single line comments can be either placed on a line by themselves or behind a snippet of code. All text following them until the next newline is commented out. 

Example: 
```
# Hi there I'm a comment!
set x = "10" # Me too!!
```
### Multi-line 
Multiline comments can span multiple lines and all characters until the closing tag are commented out. 

Example:
```
#-- 
    Wheee, look at me!
    Wow a second line?
    A third!? Woohoo!
#--
```
